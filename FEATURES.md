## Discussion

###What we have learnt?

_After the OOP course in general and the working of this project in particular, we claimed that to make a game, regardless of how hard and complicated the game required, the most important factor that helps us finish the project is the seriousness and dedication of team members, not just the leader. Even though some difficulty has occurred, as long as you keep the strong spirit in your team working, you and your friends can do it. Things can be changed due to the circumstance, and maybe the whole project affected, but that is not important if you and your friends have to be good and do all things a little in a project. Tasks distribution and contribution have shown that each of us has our different talents and specialities; However, we devoted ourselves to make the project **Zombieland** finally completed in time.
Again, thank you [**Tom Huynh**](mailto:tomhuynhsg@gmail.com) for teaching us how to use Java language from the basic, to the point we could make something fantastic like **Zombieland**._
